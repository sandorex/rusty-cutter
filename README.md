## Rusty Cutter
Rust application for fast media cutting with minimal encoding/decoding, using `ffmpeg`

Currently only the cli tool is being worked on, gui will be worked on after cli is functional

### Goal
Tool to simplify video cutting with ffmpeg without re-encoding, why waste all that power when you don't have to!

I am planning to turn this project into a full fledged node-based video editor which should work really fast even on low-end devices as there is minimal amount of encoding/decoding to do
